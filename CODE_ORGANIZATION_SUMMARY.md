# Code Organization Reorganization Summary

## Problem
The codebase had confusing overlap between native C library structures and public API models, with "Result" classes existing in both `Models.cs` and `NativeMethods.cs`, making it unclear which classes were for native interop versus public API.

## Solution
Reorganized the code to create clear separation of concerns:

### 1. **NativeMethods.cs** - Native C Library Layer
**Purpose**: Contains only low-level native C structures and interop functions
**Scope**: Internal to the library, handles direct interaction with libpg_query

**Native Structures (Internal)**:
- `PgQueryError` - Native error structure
- `PgQueryParseResult` - Native parse result 
- `PgQueryNormalizeResult` - Native normalize result
- `PgQueryFingerprintResult` - Native fingerprint result
- `PgQueryDeparseResult` - Native deparse result
- `PgQuerySplitStmt` - Native split statement
- `PgQuerySplitResult` - Native split result
- `PgQueryScanResult` - Native scan result
- `PgQueryPlpgsqlParseResult` - Native PL/pgSQL result
- `NativeScanResult` - Internal processed scan result

**Responsibilities**:
- DLL imports for all libpg_query functions
- Memory management (alloc/free operations)
- Pointer marshaling and UTF-8 string conversion
- Low-level protobuf structure handling

### 2. **Models.cs** - Public API Layer
**Purpose**: Contains only public-facing API models for end users
**Scope**: Public API, what developers interact with

**Public Models**:
- `QueryResultBase` - Base class for all query results
- `ParseResult` - Public parse result model
- `NormalizeResult` - Public normalize result model  
- `FingerprintResult` - Public fingerprint result model
- `DeparseResult` - Public deparse result model
- `SplitResult` - Public split result model
- `ScanResult` - Public scan result model
- `PlpgsqlParseResult` - Public PL/pgSQL result model
- `EnhancedScanResult` - Enhanced scan with protobuf data
- `ProtobufParseResult` - Public protobuf parse result
- `SqlStatement` - Individual SQL statement
- `SqlToken` - Individual SQL token
- `ParseOptions` - Parse configuration options

**Responsibilities**:
- JSON serialization attributes
- User-friendly properties and methods
- Success/error state management
- Type safety for end users

### 3. **NativeStructures.cs** - Shared Native Types
**Purpose**: Houses shared native structures used across the library
**Scope**: Internal, but shared between native interop components

**Shared Structures**:
- `PgQueryProtobuf` - Core protobuf structure
- `PgQueryProtobufParseResult` - Protobuf parse result

### 4. **Clear Data Flow**
```
Native C Library (libpg_query)
         ?
NativeMethods.cs (Internal native structs)
         ?
Parser.cs (Conversion layer)
         ?
Models.cs (Public API models)
         ?
End User Code
```

## Benefits

1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**: 
   - Native interop is isolated in `NativeMethods.cs`
   - Public API is clean and focused in `Models.cs`

2. **Improved Maintainability**:
   - Changes to native library only affect `NativeMethods.cs`
   - Public API changes only affect `Models.cs`
   - No confusion about which structures are for which purpose

3. **Better Encapsulation**:
   - Native implementation details are hidden from public API
   - Internal structures are marked `internal`
   - Public structures focus on usability

4. **Type Safety**:
   - Native pointers and memory management isolated
   - Public API uses safe managed types
   - Clear boundaries between unsafe and safe code

5. **Easier Testing**:
   - Native interop can be mocked at the boundary
   - Public API can be tested independently
   - Clear interfaces between layers

## Migration Notes

- **No Breaking Changes**: All public APIs remain the same
- **Internal Renaming**: `ProcessedScanResult` ? `NativeScanResult` (internal only)
- **Structure Consolidation**: Removed duplicate native structures
- **Improved Organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality

## Usage Examples

### Before (Confusing)
```csharp
// Unclear if this is native or public API
var result = SomeMethod(); // Which Result type?
```

### After (Clear)
```csharp
// Clearly public API
var parseResult = parser.Parse(query);     // Returns ParseResult from Models.cs

// Internal native operations are hidden
// NativeMethods.PgQueryParseResult is only used internally
```

This reorganization creates a much clearer architecture where:
- **Native concerns** are isolated in the `Native` namespace
- **Public API concerns** are in the main namespace  
- **No overlap or confusion** between the two layers
